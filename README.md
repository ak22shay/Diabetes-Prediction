# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Diabetes is a chronic health condition that results in high blood sugar. It is a serious health issue and a precursor to life threatning conditions like a heart-stroke. We use Machine Learning techniques to predict if a patient has chances of having diabetes. Detecting Diabetes at an early stage helps prevent serious symptoms by making an individual aware of current condition help them transition into making healthy lifestyle choices.

## About the dataset
The dataset was collected and made available by “National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as a part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database

The DataSet can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kandij/diabetes-dataset


## Conclusion
As determined by the various model evaluation metrics used above, Logistic Regression is the best model for the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. Our model's ability to predict Diabetes using some commonly used lab findings is satisfactory. These models can be implemented to assist doctors in forecasting the onset of diabetes in female patients and offering required preventive measures to avoid complications during their pregnancies or predicting diabetes at an early stage of pregnancy.

The most relevant variables in these models were Blood Glucose, Body Mass Index, Insulin, and DiabetesPedigreeFunction.

## Future Analysis
We can implement a deep neural network, along with some added relevant features and a larger dataset which would help in giving more accurate results. We can also use our models with a few modifications to cater to a larger audience including all the genders.
